                <p>I want to visit Berlin, the largest city of Germany. It's the largest city by both area and population.
                Berlin has moderate summer temperatures that can sometimes be hot and cold winter, which makes it my kind of weather.
                Berlin has beautiful architecture and landscape with over 15 foreign languages commonly spoken. Berlin has a low unemployment 
                rate that has been steadily decreasing for the past 15 years and it uses the mighty pound.

                and german is the main language of Berlin, which was the city that I said I wanted to visit in the section above.
